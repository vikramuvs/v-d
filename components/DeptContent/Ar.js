                The School of Architecture is now autonomous (affiliated to VTU)
                providing scope for further improvement. The focus has been
                towards fostering novel concepts and solutions in architectural
                design. The student’s response is very encouraging and the
                school recognises and appreciates such good students by awarding
                them. Many of the students after graduation have pursued higher
                studies in various universities in the country and abroad. There
                is a good demand for the school graduates in the industry and is
                developing initiatives towards co-branding of the industry and
                the institution school. Many have started their own enterprise
                and architectural practice as well.
              </li>
              <li>
                All this has been possible as a result of the efforts of the
                impeccable faculty of the school. The faculty is committed to
                the welfare and success of the students. The teachers of the
                school are also engaged in enhancing their knowledge and skills
                and many are engaged in research activities as well. The school
                has experts in specialized disciplines like Planning, Landscape
                Architecture and Interior Design. Faculties of the school also
                actively participate in National and International conferences
                and publish and present papers.

              <li>
                The school as part of consultancy started off with the maiden
                project to redevelop the MSRIT engineering college campus and is
                now involved in various campus designs.
              </li>
              <li>
                The school is proud to have started the M.Arch programme in
                Landscape Architecture. This was started in the year 2011. The
                Master of Landscape Architecture is a 2 year full time
                postgraduate programme. The prescribed course is two years of
                full-time study.
              </li>
              <li>
                The course consists of areas of study ranging from
                community-scale landscape planning to the details of landscape
                construction technology, with an emphasis on sustainable
                practices in landscape architecture. The course covers a broad
                spectrum of topics from local to regional scale. Balancing
                theory with hands-on practice, design aspects of landscape
                architecture is given equal prominence to direct the students
                towards a holistic approach to Sustainable Landscape
                Architecture. The course is structured to analyze and respond to
                critical issues facing contemporary landscape architectural
                design and development. Thus the students have the opportunity
                to explore alternative, innovative, and experimental design.
              </li>
              <li>
                The course will enable design and construction professionals to
                enhance their understanding of the integral relationship between
                natural processes and human activity, and how sustainable design
                fits into everyday life, explore design options to address the
                same and examine policies, regulations, and standards in
                industry and government for implementation of the principles of
                sustainable design.
