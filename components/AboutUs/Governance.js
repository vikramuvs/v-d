              Dr. M.S. Ramaiah, a visionary, educationist, industrialist and
              philanthropist founded “Gokula Education Foundation (GEF)” in the
              year 1962 and under the aegis of this foundation was born “M.S.
              Ramaiah Institute of Technology (MSRIT)” in the same year. Dr.
              M.S. Ramaiah, a successful entrepreneur by the end of the first
              decade after independence, realized that the socio-political and
              economic edifice of this country must be built on the solid base
              of education. At that time, the opportunities for professional
              education, be it in Engineering field or in Medical field, were
              too limited to fulfill the aspirations of the large number of
              bright and talented students of this country. It was in this
              context that Dr. M.S. Ramaiah established the GEF and under its
              aegis MSRIT, a pioneering effort in the area of private,
              self-financed technical education system. His vision, ideals and
              goals, which were implicit in the functioning of GEF, are
              reflected in the articulation of the mission of GEF. Today
              eighteen institutions, including MSRIT, are successfully running
              under the umbrella of GEF.

                  institute in engineering education. After seven years, in

                  Governing council for this college also. He led these
                  institutions to become very strong in post graduate education

                  on the campus comprising of students from all over India and
                  abroad. It has been his determination and sustained effort
                  that has made each of these institutions as a ‘Centre of
                  Excellence’. After the demise of his father, he created a
                  superspeciality hospital in memory of his father, and this
                  hospital has become a pride of Bangalore today. The MSR School
