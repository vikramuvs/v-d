              Dr. M.S. Ramaiah, a visionary, educationist, industrialist and
              philanthropist founded “Gokula Education Foundation (GEF)” in the
              year 1962 and under the aegis of this foundation was born “M.S.
              Ramaiah Institute of Technology (MSRIT)” in the same year. Dr.
              M.S. Ramaiah, a successful entrepreneur by the end of the first
              decade after independence, realized that the socio-political and
              economic edifice of this country must be built on the solid base
              of education. At that time, the opportunities for professional
              education, be it in Engineering field or in Medical field, were
              too limited to fulfill the aspirations of the large number of
              bright and talented students of this country. It was in this
              context that Dr. M.S. Ramaiah established the GEF and under its
              aegis MSRIT, a pioneering effort in the area of private,
              self-financed technical education system. His vision, ideals and
              goals, which were implicit in the functioning of GEF, are
              reflected in the articulation of the mission of GEF. Today
              eighteen institutions, including MSRIT, are successfully running
              under the umbrella of GEF.

                  Karnataka. Born in 1947 Dr. Jayaram had his education in
                  Bangalore city and graduated in commerce. Since his young age
                  he showed lot of interest in managing the educational
                  institutions supporting his father in all the development
                  activities. In 1972, at the tender age of 25, Dr. Jayaram has
                  taken the responsibility of Chairman of the Governing Council
                  (now the GB) of M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology (MSRIT).
                  His acumen and managerial capabilities brought laurels to the
                  institute which has become widely known to be a premier
                  institute in engineering education. After seven years, in
                  1979, when M.S. Ramaiah Medical College (MSRMC) was
                  established, he assumed the office of the Chairman of
                  Governing council for this college also. He led these
                  institutions to become very strong in post graduate education
                  and research, apart from acquiring a great name in under
                  graduate education. Dr. M.R. Jayaram has been responsible for
                  placing these institutions as the premier institutions in this
                  country, finding a place in the top 25 institution in the
                  country in their respective fields. As on today GEF has
                  established 18 colleges/schools on its 85-acre Gnanagangothri
                  Campus. The Schools include engineering, medicine, nursing,
                  dental, law, management, etc., with more than 11,000 students
                  on the campus comprising of students from all over India and
                  abroad. It has been his determination and sustained effort
                  that has made each of these institutions as a ‘Centre of
                  Excellence’. After the demise of his father, he created a
                  superspeciality hospital in memory of his father, and this
                  hospital has become a pride of Bangalore today. The MSR School
                  of Advanced Studies is also his creation.
