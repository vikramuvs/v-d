                    M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology (MSRIT) was started in
                    1962 by Late Dr. M S Ramaiah, our Founder Chairman who was a
                    renowned visionary, philanthropist, and a pioneer in
                    creating several landmark infrastructure projects in India.
                    Noticing the shortage of talented engineering professionals
                    required to build a modern India, Dr. M S Ramaiah envisioned
                    MSRIT as an institute of excellence imparting quality and
                    affordable education. Part of Gokula Education Foundation,
                    MSRIT has grown over the years with significant
                    contributions from various professionals in different
                    capacities, ably led by Dr. M S Ramaiah himself, whose
                    personal commitment has seen the institution through its
                    formative years. Today, MSRIT stands tall as one of India’s
                    finest names in Engineering Education and has produced
                    around 35,000 engineering professionals who occupy
                    responsible positions across the globe.
